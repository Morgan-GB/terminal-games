# Terminal Games
 
As I've been out of the programming scene for a little while now, I've decided to make a few games to play in the terminal!

# Games

- [ ] Tic Tac Toe
- [ ] Connect 4

# How to Play

1. Clone the GitHub repository:

`git clone https://github.com/MorganWJones/terminal-games`

2. Open the `terminal-games` folder in your terminal

`cd terminal-games`

3. Type `node .` and the name of the game (replace any spaces with a dash)!

`node . tic-tac-toe`

To list all available games, type:

`node . --list`
